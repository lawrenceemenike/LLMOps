# LLMOps Short Course - Practice Scripts
## Introduction
Welcome! This repository contains the practice scripts I used during the LLMOps short course by deeplearning.AI. The course was an insightful journey into the LLMOps pipeline, covering everything from pre-processing training data for supervised instruction tuning to deploying a custom LLM.

## What I Learned
### 1. The Fundamentals
The course started with the basics of LLMs and the importance of LLMOps in creating efficient and effective language models. We delved into the key components and workflows involved in managing and optimizing these models.

### 2. Data Preparation
We learned how to retrieve and transform training data essential for the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. This step is crucial for ensuring the model is trained on relevant and high-quality data.

### 3. Automation and Orchestration with Pipelines
A significant part of the course was dedicated to setting up and configuring an open-source supervised tuning pipeline using tools like Kubeflow Pipelines and Google Cloud. This automation streamlines the process of training and deploying LLMs.

### 4. Prediction, Prompts, Safety
We explored how to output and study safety scores to monitor and filter the LLM’s behavior responsibly. This ensures the deployed models operate within acceptable safety and ethical standards.

### 5. Conclusion
The course wrapped up by summarizing the key steps of the LLMOps pipeline and the best practices for maintaining and iterating on deployed models.

## Tools Practiced
BigQuery: Used for data warehousing and management.
Kubeflow Pipelines: Employed for automating the machine learning workflows.
Google Cloud: Provided the infrastructure and tools for deploying and managing the LLMs.

## Who Should Join?
This course is ideal for anyone interested in learning how to tune LLMs and build efficient LLMOps pipelines. Whether you’re a beginner or have some experience with LLMs, this course provides valuable insights and practical skills.

Feel free to explore the scripts in this repository to see the practical implementations of the concepts covered in the course. Happy learning!

## Note: The repository includes the Jupyter notebook LLMOps.ipynb that contains all the practice scripts and examples used throughout the course.
